        <h2>To set up visual studio code first type visual studio code in google then click on the first link. Then
            choose your PC Windows or Apple etc and then click on download.</h2>
        <h3> If you need to execute custom code, often console applications allow you to write the code you need in your
            favorite environment. Console applications can be executed from the command line by default which allows for
            simple server-side automation or client-based scripting. </h3>
        <h4> You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log
            function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To
            open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console. </h4>
